    You are tasked with analyzing the health impact of a packaged food product based on the provided product details in JSON format. Your goal is to provide a thorough analysis covering both the positive and negative aspects of the product from a health perspective. The analysis must also check for allergens, compliance with certain diets, harmful ingredients, and provide recommendations for healthier alternatives. The final output should be in the following JSON format.

    Required Analysis:
    1. Positive Impact Tags: Identify and list concise, fact-checked positive impact tags based on the provided product information. Focus on health and sustainability benefits such as high protein, low sugar, vitamins, or minerals. When mentioning fats, only include tags related to healthy fats if they come from beneficial sources like avocados, nuts, or olive oil. Avoid listing 'high fat' as a positive tag and instead list the source of the healthy fat. Ensure all tags are relevant and avoid unnecessary descriptions.

    2. Negative Impact Tags: Identify and list concise, fact-checked negative impact tags based on the provided product information. Focus on health and environmental concerns such as high sugar, sodium, artificial additives, or unsustainable practices. When mentioning fats, include specific tags like 'High Saturated Fat' or 'High Trans Fat' if the product contains these. Ensure all tags are relevant and clearly indicate why they negatively affect the consumer, avoiding unnecessary descriptions.

    3. Allergens: Check for the presence of common allergens from these only [Peanuts, Eggs, Wheat, Soybeans, Milk, Fish, Tree Nuts, Sesame Seeds] and list any allergens found. Do not add any other allergen than these.

    4. Dietary Compliance: Determine which common diets the product complies with, and for each diet provide a brief description of why it is compliant. If it does not comply with any specific diet, state that.

    5. Harmful Ingredients: Identify and list any harmful or controversial ingredients present, such as trans fats, artificial sweeteners, artificial preservatives, etc.

    6. Rating: Provide a rating for how healthy the product is based on all the analyzed factors (positive and negative impacts, harmful ingredients). The rating should be on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being unhealthy, 5 being very healthy).

    7. Recommendations for Healthier Alternatives: Suggest 3 healthier alternative products from the same category (e.g., healthier versions of the same type of snack, beverage, etc.) For alternatives, make sure you are recommending packaged food and not home made food alternatives. Also keep in mind to recommend only those alternatives which are available in Indian Markets.

    8. Portion Size: Based on the product's QUANTITY and type, give a **common portion size** in grams along with a **reference in terms of portion** (e.g., for a 400g bread, the common portion size would be 50g, which means 2 slices of bread or for a 250g cereal, common portion size would be 30g, which means 1 bowl). The reference should be in easily understandable terms like "2 biscuits," "1 handful of namkeen," "1 slice of bread," etc.
    
    The response should only contain the following JSON format:

    {
      
      "positive": [<list of positive impacts>],  // Example: ['High Protein', 'Low Fat']
      "negative": [<list of negative impacts>],  // Example: ['High sugar', 'Low Fiber']
      "allergens": [<list of allergens found>],  // Example: ['peanuts', 'wheat']
      "diet": [
        {
          "name": <diet name>,  // Example: 'vegan', 'keto'
          "description": <brief explanation of compliance or non-compliance>
        }
      ],
      "harmful_ingredients": [<list of harmful ingredients>],  // Example: ['trans fats', 'aspartame'],
      "rating": <rating>,  // A decimal number from 1 to 5
      "recommendations": [<alternative product 1>, <alternative product 2>, <alternative product 3>]  // Suggest 3 healthier alternative products
      "portion_size_grams": <portion size in grams> // A decimal number, Example: 50.5, 20.0
      "portion_size": <portion size> // Example: 2 slices of bread, 2 biscuits, 1 handful of namkeen, 
    }

    Instructions:
    1. Evaluate the productâ€™s ingredients and nutritional values carefully to determine its positive and negative health impacts.
    2. Identify any common allergens based on the ingredient list.
