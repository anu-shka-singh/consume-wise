    You are a nutritionist tasked with analyzing a meal based on its content of calories, fat, and protein. Your goal is to calculate the total calories, fat, and protein the user's meal contains, based on the input provided. Additionally, you should offer comments on the meal's overall nutritional value and suggest ways to make the meal more wholesome if necessary. Lastly, provide an estimate of the time required to burn the total calories from the meal through walking and jogging.

    Please follow these instructions:
    1. If any inedible item is mentioned, return null. 
    2. If the quantity of food is not mentioned, make reasonable assumptions based on common serving sizes.
    3. If insufficient details are provided, base the analysis on popular recipes of the mentioned meal.

    Provide the response in the following valid JSON object (using integers for calories, fat, and protein, and strings for comments and time estimates):
    {
      "user_meal": "",
      "total_calories": 0,
      "total_fat": 0,

Future<String> healthAnalysis(Map<String, dynamic> product) async {
  final prompt = '''
    You are tasked with analyzing the health impact of a packaged food product based on the provided product details in JSON format. Your goal is to provide a thorough analysis covering both the positive and negative aspects of the product from a health perspective. The analysis must also check for allergens, compliance with certain diets, harmful ingredients, and provide recommendations for healthier alternatives. The final output should be in the following JSON format.

    Required Analysis:
    1. Positive Impact Tags: Identify and list concise, fact-checked positive impact tags based on the provided product information. Focus on health and sustainability benefits such as high protein, low sugar, vitamins, or minerals. If the product is overall unhealthy (e.g., processed foods like instant noodles), avoid listing positive attributes such as high protein, as this could encourage consumption. Include only genuinely beneficial tags. When mentioning fats, list the source (e.g., avocados, nuts) if it provides healthy fats, avoiding 'high fat' as a positive tag. Benchmark values to consider a nutrient "high" are based on general guidelines:
      * Protein: >10g per serving
      * Carbohydrates: >20g per serving (focus on complex carbs)
      * Fiber: >5g per serving
      * Healthy fats (e.g., unsaturated): >7g per serving

    2. Negative Impact Tags: Identify and list concise, fact-checked negative impact tags based on the provided product information. Focus on health and environmental concerns such as high sugar, sodium, artificial additives, or unsustainable practices. If the product contains unhealthy fats, use specific tags like 'High Saturated Fat' (>5g per serving) or 'High Trans Fat' (>0g, as these are considered harmful in any amount). Avoid unnecessary descriptions, and ensure that the negative tags clearly indicate why the product may negatively affect health or the environment.
    
    3. Allergens: Check for the presence of common allergens from these only [Peanuts, Eggs, Wheat, Soybeans, Milk, Fish, Tree Nuts, Sesame Seeds] and list any allergens found. Do not add any other allergen than these.

    4. Dietary Compliance: Determine which common diets the product complies with, and for each diet provide a brief description of why it is compliant. If it does not comply with any specific diet, state that.

    5. Harmful Ingredients: Identify and list any harmful or controversial ingredients present, such as trans fats, artificial sweeteners, artificial preservatives, etc.

    6. Rating: Provide a rating for how healthy the product is based on all the analyzed factors (positive and negative impacts, ingredients, nutrients and other headings in product information). The rating should be on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being unhealthy, 5 being very healthy).

    7. Recommendations for Healthier Alternatives: Suggest 3 healthier alternative products from the same category (e.g., healthier versions of the same type of snack, beverage, etc.) For alternatives, make sure you are recommending packaged food and not home made food alternatives. Also keep in mind to recommend only those alternatives which are available in Indian Markets.

    8. Portion Size: Based on the product's QUANTITY and type, give a **common portion size** in grams along with a **reference in terms of portion** (e.g., for a 400g bread, the common portion size would be 50g, which means 2 slices of bread or for a 250g cereal, common portion size would be 30g, which means 1 bowl). The reference should be in easily understandable terms like "2 biscuits," "1 handful of namkeen," "1 slice of bread," etc.
    
    The response should only contain the following JSON format:

    {
      
      "positive": [<list of positive impacts>],  // Example: ['High Protein', 'Low Fat']
      "negative": [<list of negative impacts>],  // Example: ['High sugar', 'Low Fiber']
      "allergens": [<list of allergens found>],  // Example: ['peanuts', 'wheat']

      ],
      "harmful_ingredients": [<list of harmful ingredients>],  // Example: ['trans fats', 'aspartame'],
      "rating": <rating>,  // A decimal number from 1 to 5
      "recommendations": [<alternative product 1>, <alternative product 2>, <alternative product 3>]  // Suggest 3 healthier alternative products
      "portion_size_grams": <portion size in grams> // A decimal number, Example: 50.5, 20.0
      "portion_size": <portion size> // Example: 2 slices of bread, 2 biscuits, 1 handful of namkeen, 
    }

    Instructions:
    1. Evaluate the productâ€™s ingredients and nutritional values carefully to determine its positive and negative health impacts.
    2. Identify any common allergens based on the ingredient list.
    3. Analyze which diets the product complies with and provide a brief description.
